# OwlTakes - Seamless Tablet Interaction with Software-based Palm Rejection

## Project Overview

OwlTakes is a revolutionary application that tackles the common problem of accidental palm inputs on tablets without built-in palm rejection. Many users struggle with unintentional marks while using a stylus, leading to frustration and inaccurate notes. Our innovative software provides a cost-effective and accessible solution, eliminating the need for expensive hardware upgrades.

## Challenge 

Tablets lacking active palm rejection disrupt the natural flow of digital note-taking and annotation. Users often face erroneous inputs or the high cost of specialized tablets that offer this feature.

## Our Intelligent Solution

OwlTakes uses intelligent backend logic to differentiate between the small contact area of a stylus and the larger surface area of a palm. When multiple touches are detected, our software prioritizes and registers only the stylus input, ignoring palm touches. This ensures a fluid and precise digital writing experience.

## Feasibility & Far-Reaching Impact

OwlTakes addresses a significant market need, providing a reliable solution for enhanced annotation and note-taking. Its algorithm-based approach ensures high accuracy and is designed to bypass hardware limitations, making it accessible to a wide range of existing devices. The software is also built for scalability, with potential for future enhancements using advanced techniques like Machine Learning.

## Using the Repo

First Install the Flutter and Dart SDK using the following links - https://docs.flutter.dev/ & https://dart.dev/ respectively with also installing Android Studio - https://developer.android.com/studio.
Set up correct PATH and as mentioned in Flutter Docs set up the both SDKs with Android Studio. Now after installing Flutter and Dart & setting up the extensions of Flutter & Dart in Android Studio, clone the repo and open it in Android Studio and run the main.dart file in lib folder. Don't forget to connect your mobile or tablet device to Laptop in Debug Mode :)
