# OwlTakes - Seamless Tablet Interaction with Software-based Palm Rejection

## Project Overview

OwlTakes is a groundbreaking application designed to revolutionize how users interact with tablet devices, especially those lacking built-in active palm rejection. Many individuals struggle with accidental inputs from their palm resting on the screen while using a stylus for note-taking or annotations, leading to frustration and inaccuracies. Our innovative software provides a robust, cost-effective, and accessible solution, eliminating the need for users to invest in expensive tablets equipped with integrated hardware palm rejection.

## Challenge 

The pervasive issue of tablet devices lacking active palm rejection significantly impedes the natural flow of digital note-taking and annotation. This deficiency often forces users to either endure erroneous inputs, constantly adjust their hand position, or face the high cost associated with purchasing new, specialized tablets that offer this crucial feature. OwlTakes directly confronts this challenge, providing a universal remedy that enhances user experience without hardware upgrades.

## Our Intelligent Solution

OwlTakes employs a sophisticated backend logic that intelligently differentiates between the minuscule contact area of a stylus tip and the significantly larger surface area of a human palm. This fundamental distinction forms the bedrock of our solution. When multiple touch inputs are detected on the screen concurrently, our backend code is meticulously engineered to prioritize and register solely the input originating from the smallest contact area (the stylus), while intelligently disregarding any inputs from larger areas, such as the palm. This ensures a fluid and precise digital writing or drawing experience.

## Feasibility & Far-Reaching Impact

OwlTakes directly addresses a clear and pressing market need for tablet users, providing a robust solution for enhanced annotation and note-taking. The software's algorithm-based approach ensures high accuracy and reliability, minimizing the chances of incorrect operation. Crucially, OwlTakes is designed to bypass hardware limitations, making its benefits accessible to a vast user base on their existing devices. Furthermore, the software is built with scalability in mind, capable of being significantly enhanced through advanced techniques such as Machine Learning (ML) Algorithms, Velocity, Time Duration Filtering, Beizer Curves, and Kalman Filter Algorithm.
